Module 10 Challenge - CU Bootcamps

The majority resource that I used was just going back and watching recordings from past classes to refresh my memory on which functions or statements and their syntaxes I need to be focusing in on. I received guidance and assistance from a couple online resources, including slack discussions, Stackoverflow, and the OpenAI community in writing this code. There were a couple of things that were not covered at all in class, nonetheless I was able to find the answers I wanted!

I was unsure which file the code was supposed to go, so I wrote and troubleshot everything in the jupyter notebook, and once it was all complete I copied it over to the app.py file.
